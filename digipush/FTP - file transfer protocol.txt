FTP - file transfer protocol 
      port number 20 (Data Transfer) and 21 (Command control)
      If we want to setup secure ftp that time we use FTP Over SSH this is Known as SFTP - secure file transfer protocol Port NO (22)

      

      Deamon -> It is a program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user   

      command - #sleep (Delay for specified ammount of time)
                syntax -> sleep 20 (sec)

                #top -> task manager which processes are running in the background  (Onliner - Givers linux processes)

                #htop 

                #atop -> advanced system and process monitor

                #ps -> report a snapshot of current processes
                       -a -> 
                       -axjf ->

                #kill -9 -> signal kill (sleep kill)
                  syntax -> kill -9 pid (process id) (PPID -> Parent Process ID)
            
                # sleep 100 & -> Deamon process

                # ss -> another utility to investigate sockets 
                        Windows - netstat
                        used to see the open ports 
                        -atp -> all tcp processes
                        -antp -> all port numbers of tcp processes

                        when the local address is 0.0.0.0 -> it signifies that it is listening on all the interfaces




      whenever the linux start first the init process starts 



task -> (1. read zombie process )
2. explore top commands




package -> VSFTPD (Very Secure FTP Daemon) 

      install it 
      status 
      
      remotely connect -> ssh USERNAME@IP
                          ftp USERNAME@IP

                          ssh IP -> put it on the windows (IP -> Debian)
                                    if you do not provide the username then it will use the system username as the username on remote machine 
                          ftp IP -> username after the IP
                                    dir -> to list the files or you can use ls 
                                    to copy that file from linux to windows -> get command (e.g get attendance.sh) 
                                    c:/users/ditiss (here you will find the files by default)

                                    to cpy from windows to linux -> put command (e.g put win10.iso) 

                                    here write is disabled -> to change the config 
                                          /etc/vdftpd.conf

                                          here line no 31 write_enable=YES //uncomment this line 

                                          restart the vdftpd 

                                    to delete the files -> delete command is used 

                                    -- ls -lh (human readable file size )


            ## FIleZilla (FTP Client) just like putty
            optional offer (decline) baki next
            host -> where do you want to connect 


            now for SFTP -> 
             
how should i use the sftp in the linux as it is using only the 21 , and 22 port as you have only shown using filezilla 


secure copy 

      to run the (scp) command prereq is that it is required that that machine should have ssh service running on it 

      syntax : scp (relative path source - here in our case windows is source) (USERNAME@IP(: this is mandatory)absolute path of the destination - here in our case star user and its home directory)  
      make sure user must have write permission there 


      finger -> user information lookup program 
      finger USERNAME -> gives info about user !!

            ~/.nofinger -> read it used for Security
