WSB windows server backup :
	IMP service
	helps to backup the server appropriately
	req -> ideally we took the backup on extra disk 
		for that purpose we should have extra harddisk attached to our server 
		the purpose of harddisk is backup

setting storage -> actual size ??
		additional harddisk -> 	take a backup in network device (NAS)
		it is connected with the network 
		write permission required 
		if the backup is taken on the same disk then there might be issue if the disk gets corrupted !!!!!!!

	add hard disk -> create -> size -> 100GB or more than that -> change the name ends with backup.vdi -> do not select pre allocate -> Finish	
	choose -> ok

2. Start the Machine -> Goto disk management -> Allocate the space
